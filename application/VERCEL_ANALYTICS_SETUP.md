# Vercel Analytics Setup

## Overview
This project now includes **Vercel Analytics** and **Vercel Speed Insights** for comprehensive monitoring and performance tracking.

## What's Been Added

### 1. Vercel Analytics (@vercel/analytics)
- **Purpose**: Tracks page views, user interactions, and custom events
- **Location**: Added to `app/layout.js` 
- **Features**:
  - Automatic page view tracking
  - User interaction monitoring
  - Custom event tracking capabilities
  - Privacy-focused (no cookies, GDPR compliant)
  - Real-time dashboard in Vercel

### 2. Vercel Speed Insights (@vercel/speed-insights)
- **Purpose**: Monitors Core Web Vitals and performance metrics
- **Location**: Added to `app/layout.js`
- **Features**:
  - Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS)
  - Performance monitoring
  - Real User Monitoring (RUM)
  - Performance insights dashboard

## Implementation Details

### Installation
```bash
npm install @vercel/analytics @vercel/speed-insights
```

### Configuration
Both components are automatically configured in `app/layout.js`:

```javascript
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";
import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ClientLayout>{children}</ClientLayout>
        {/* Vercel Analytics - tracks page views and user interactions */}
        <Analytics />
        {/* Vercel Speed Insights - monitors performance metrics */}
        <SpeedInsights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Analytics Features

### Automatic Tracking
- **Page Views**: Automatically tracked on route changes
- **User Sessions**: Session tracking without cookies
- **Geographic Data**: Country-level analytics
- **Device Info**: Browser, OS, and device type

### Custom Events (Optional)
You can track custom events using the `track` function:

```javascript
import { track } from '@vercel/analytics';

// Track custom events
track('button_click', { button_name: 'cta_signup' });
track('form_submit', { form_type: 'contact' });
```

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Analytics are disabled in development mode
- **Production**: Automatically enabled when deployed to Vercel
- **Custom Domain**: Works with both Vercel domains and custom domains

## Accessing Analytics Data

### Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Analytics" tab
3. View real-time and historical data

### Speed Insights Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Speed Insights" tab
3. Monitor Core Web Vitals and performance metrics

## Privacy & Compliance
- **No Cookies**: Uses localStorage and sessionStorage
- **GDPR Compliant**: No personal data collection
- **Privacy-First**: Minimal data collection
- **Opt-out Support**: Users can disable tracking

## Multiple Analytics Setup
This project now runs **three analytics solutions**:
1. **Plausible Analytics** (existing) - Privacy-focused web analytics
2. **Vercel Analytics** (new) - Page views and user interactions
3. **Vercel Speed Insights** (new) - Performance monitoring

Each provides different insights:
- **Plausible**: General web analytics, visitor behavior
- **Vercel Analytics**: Technical performance, user flows
- **Speed Insights**: Core Web Vitals, performance metrics

## Best Practices
1. **Monitor Regularly**: Check analytics weekly for insights
2. **Performance First**: Use Speed Insights to optimize Core Web Vitals
3. **Custom Events**: Track important user interactions
4. **Privacy Policy**: Update your privacy policy to include analytics
5. **Performance Budget**: Set performance budgets based on Speed Insights data

## Troubleshooting
- **Not Seeing Data**: Analytics only work in production (Vercel deployment)
- **Missing Events**: Ensure proper deployment to Vercel
- **Slow Loading**: Speed Insights will help identify bottlenecks
- **Development Mode**: Analytics are disabled in development

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Vercel to see analytics in action
2. Monitor Core Web Vitals and optimize accordingly
3. Set up custom events for important user actions
4. Review analytics weekly for insights and optimization opportunities
